Movie Picker

<p>
There were two of the most difficult things, and one of them was at the very beginning. What should I make? I finally decided on an app that picks a random movie, if the user wants to watch something, but can't decide on what. Of my two biggest challenges, this was the only one I solved.
</p>
<br />
<p>
Next came planning. It was at this point that my partner, Yousou, switched out of the class. I thought it 100 movies would be a good number for the app. We also needed 3 sensors. This was the second problem.
</p>
<br />
<p>
The design was next. I decided to use an accelerometer, so you shook the device to get a new film. I also added a slider. Left was for a lighter tone, right was for a darker tone. I also added a web viewer to put the RottonTomatoes page of each film.
</p>
<br />
<p>
Finally, there was programming. It was easy but time-consuming, as I entered each film individually. I made it so the slider's position, when the device was shook, chose between different groups of films (separated by tone). At the end it all worked, but I never got the other 2 sensors, as I couldn't think of any place or use for them.
